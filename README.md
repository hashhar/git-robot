# Git Robot

Ever felt the need to be able to run a git command on all of the repositories on your system (or a select few within a directory)? Then this is for you.

# Installation

Really?
```
git clone https://github.com/hashhar/git-robot.git
cd git-robot
./git-command                // where git-command is one of the scripts in the repository
```

# Usage

```
./git-command --help
```

# How to Contribute

- You should open issues for bugs, feature requests (check the roadmap before posting a request) or even typos.
- Feel free to suggest better ways of doing stuff.
- All the work you do should be on a clone/fork of the **master branch**. Do all the work on a separate branch, not the master.
- Submit a pull request if you are interested (but only after opening an issue please).

# Roadmap
